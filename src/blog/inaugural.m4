_BLOG(`Inaugural post', `2023-03-24')

This post marks the first entry to the blog, and the start of this website. Content could be coming in a couple days along with some changes to the layout and an RSS feed for the cool.

As of writing, this site is generated using standard UNIX tools and could very well be generated on literally any compliant system, but all I have is Linux to test with.

I have also tried to make the markup language (an extension to m4 via macros) unintrusive to allow it to easily be translated to HTML and sooner or later, Gemini.
