newsd is a web-based newsfeed (RSS, Atom) reader written in Go. It is written to be reasonably lightweight and work on all of my devices, since I read a lot of feeds and it is really painful to sync them across three different devices. newsd solves this by simply being accessible from the Internet, but I plan to implement other features which would make it easy for feeds to be exported or even read from newsd over an API.

_B(`newsd is a work in progress.') I use it in production, but I do not consider it stable nor production-grade. There's many issues with it. Consider it alpha-quality software.
